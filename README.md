# Course Recommendation API

Welcome to the **Course Recommendation API**! This repository provides a powerful API for recommending online courses tailored to users' preferences. It leverages machine learning to help users find the most relevant courses based on their interests, course types, and preferred duration.

---

## Features

- **Personalized Recommendations**: Generate course suggestions based on category, type, and duration preferences.
- **Scalable and Flexible**: Easily extendable to include additional features or integrate with other services.
- **Machine Learning-Powered**: Powered by TensorFlow, delivering accurate and relevant recommendations.
- **User-Friendly API Documentation**: Swagger UI available at `/api/recommend` for quick and easy API interaction.
